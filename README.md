# Sparkify
Sparkify is a music streaming service just as Spotify and Pandora.  The data provided is user log of the service and additional information on users. We analyzed log and build models to identify customers who are highly likely to churn and thus, send marketing offers to them to prevent them from churning.   We also did EDA to establish features, and trained 3 machine learning classification models.
